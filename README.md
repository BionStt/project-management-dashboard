Project managers, 

Do you feel constrained with all the complexity and 'red-tape' that gets in the way of you and delivery? 
Manage your projects with a single page now. Update with ease and be on top of your game.

### Attributions:

This work was inspired by [OPPM](https://oppmi.com/) and developed further with contribution from [Peter Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-edwards-33331998/) to incorporate more important constituents of a project.

### Main features:

1. Single page project status report, recommeded viewed on A3 or A4
2. Schedule (based on gantt) that combines dependencies, timeframes, Owners, helpers and key project objectives
3. Information encoded along x-axis, y-axis, colors and shapes to reflect multiple dimensions. Traffic lights (red/amber/green) use to raise flag and shapes used to provide additional detail (such as impact to cost, schedule or multiple)
4. Sections to cover project external dependencies, risks, issues, summary and forecast
5. Graphs and sparklines provided with linked data entry tables
